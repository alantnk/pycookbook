#  Making a Directory or Zip File Runnable As a Main Script

"""
If your application program has grown into multiple files, you can put it into its own
directory and add a __main__.py file. For example, you can create a directory like this:

q3_package/
    spam.py
    __main__.py

If __main__.py is present, you can simply run the Python interpreter on the top-level
directory like this:

$ python3 q3_package
